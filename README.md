# Lab-3-Healthcare-and-Wellness-Clustering

**ABSTRACT**

In this project, I was attempting to provide a health organization with greater insight 
into patient-level wellness by grouping people by their lifestyle habits. The dataset that I 
included consisted of exercise time in minutes, healthy meals per day, sleep hours, stress 
level, and bore an indication of body mass index (BMI). To separate similar patients I 
developed three clustering techniques: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering and DBSCAN. I 
also utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the overall complexity of the 
dataset and help visualize our clustering results. The silhouette scores were on the lower end 
but still provided useful clusters that can inform the development of personalized wellness 
programs.  

In addition to evaluating the model outputs, I created labelled wellness profiles based 
on reference ranges for the various features. I organized the variables into high, medium and 
low categories to better interpret the cluster behaviours. In this phase, I noticed patterns such 
as low physical activity with high BMI or a combination of balanced things with 3 or 4 
features. These wellness profiles can inform healthcare providers on the necessary baselines 
to capitalize on and develop actions that support long-term health improvements by 
consideration of the various groups of patients.
